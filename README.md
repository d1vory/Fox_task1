# Anagram Console Application

## Description

This project is a console application that reverses each word in an input line while keeping all non-alphabetic symbols in their original places. Words are defined as sequences of alphabetic characters separated by spaces. Spaces and other non-alphabetic symbols are not removed or altered in their positions within the input string.

## Features

- Reverses each word in the input line.
- Keeps all non-alphabetic symbols in their original positions.
- Retains all spaces in their original positions as well.

### Examples

1. Input: `"abcd efgh"`
   Output: `"dcba hgfe"`

2. Input: `"Test"`
   Output: `"tseT"`

3. Input: `"a1bcd efg!h"`
   Output: `"d1cba hgf!e"`

4. Input: `"  a1bcd    efg!h"`
   Output: `"  d1cba    hgf!e"`
